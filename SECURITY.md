# Security Policy

Security is paramount at Simple Comment. I will respond to security disclosures immediately and with gratitude.

## Supported Versions

All versions are supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

First, thank you! Here are several options:

1. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/rendall/simple-comment/issues/new) with this information:
   - describing in general terms the nature of the vulnerability (if possible), and
   - the best way to contact you privately.
2. [Visit rendall.dev](https://www.rendall.dev/) which has many ways to contact me directly, including phone!
3. <https://keybase.io/rendall> also has ways (some overlapping with rendall.dev) to contact me directly.
