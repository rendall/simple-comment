- User profiles
  - See comments
  - Avatar

 <details>
  <summary><b>Done!</b></summary>

- All API endpoint respond as expected
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` responds to `.env` variables

## Setup

The assumption is that the API will run in a separate Netlify website and be accessed cross-origin. It is a _necessary_ requirement that the pages where you want Simple Comments to run _must_ be served via _https:_ If you already have a Netlify account and want to integrate Simple Comment with your site, open an issue and we'll create instructions.

1. Fork this repository to your own account
1. `git clone https://github.com/<your-github-profile>/simple-comment` replacing
   `<your-github-profile>`
1. `cd simple-comment`
1. `yarn install` (or `npm install`)
1. Copy and rename `example.env` as `.env`
1. In `.env`, enter your own, secret values, replacing everything to the right
   of the `=` in every case:
   1. SIMPLE_COMMENT_MODERATOR_ID
   1. SIMPLE_COMMENT_MODERATOR_PASSWORD
   1. JWT_SECRET
   1. HASH_SECRET
1. sign up for a free MongoDB Atlas account
   1. [Follow these instructions](docs/MONGODB_ATLAS.md)
   1. In `.env` add the proper `DB_CONNECION_STRING`
1. Sign up for a Netlify account, begin a new website, and link your repository
   to the new website
   1. Navigate to 'Build & Deploy => Environment`
   1. Under `Environmental Variables` click the button `Edit Variables`
   1. For each entry in `.env` add the key and corresponding value for _all_
      variables
   1. For `SIMPLE_COMMENT_MODE` add the value `production`
1. Modify your website. These are simple instructions, but feel free to hack away
   1. In the HTML for each page on your website where you want Simple Comment to run, add these two tags:
      1. `<script src="[path-to]/simple-comment.js" defer></script>` (`src` must point to the `simple-comment.js` file)
      1. `<div id="simple-comment-area"></div>`
   1. Upload the `simple-comment.js` file to your website's script folder
   1. Upload the `login.html` page on the root of your website (or somewhere accessible)
1. It should now be possible to leave and read comments on your website

### Troubleshooting

- Error: `Refused to connect to 'api/auth' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: connect-src 'self'`
  - Add `https://<your-comment-app>.netlify.app` to your Content Security Policy header next to `connect-src` (q.v.
    <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/connect-src>)
- Error:
  `Access to fetch at 'https://<your-comment-app>.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/' from origin '<your-website>' has been blocked by CORS policy...`
  - Add `<your-website>` to the `ALLOW_ORIGIN` key in `.env` and as a Netlify environmental variable

## Moderating

1. Visit the `login.html` page you uploaded in _Setup_ and
1. Log in using the `SIMPLE_COMMENT_MODERATOR_ID` and `SIMPLE_COMMENT_MODERATOR_PASSWORD` values in your `.env` file

## Default build

The default stack uses Netlify + _MongoDB_ for the backend, and a minimal `fetch` based client for the frontend, but it can be readily adapted to use any technology stack, as long as the tests pass and the API conforms to the Open API 3 schema file

You can get your own free-tier MongoDB-in-the-cloud by [following these instructions](./docs/MONGODB_ATLAS.md)

## API

The API specification is described by the file [simple-comment-api.json](./src/schema/simple-comment-api.json) in Open API 3 format and is designed to be interchangeable with any backend, frontend and identification system

This is an overview of the _Simple Comment API_ endpoints

### `/comment`

A `comment` is text that a user posts in reply to either another `comment` or a `topic`, and presenting these replies is the sole reason this project exists!

The comment endpoint is for the creation, reading, updating and deleting (CRUD) of individual comments. All comments must have a parent, that is, something it replies to, whether a `topic` or `comment`

### `/topic`

A topic is a special kind of comment that by default can only be created by admin users, and forms an organizational bucket for comments that reply. It is a kind of root comment, and therefore has no parent

The /topic endpoint handles CRUD for these root comments. A GET operation of `/topic` will get a list of topics and GET on `/topic/{topicId}` will get all comments in reply to that topic and their descendents

### `/user`

By default, comments can be posted by anonymous users, but _Simple Comment_ does have a minimal identification scheme so that commenters who choose to do so can have control over their comments after the are posted, according to policy

### `/auth`

Auth is the endpoint for the authentication and identification scheme. A user submits their username and password to the auth endpoint, and receives a JSON Web Token (JWT) that authenticates them as that user for other CRUD operations

### `/verify`

Returns the logged-in user id or `401`

## policy

`policy` is an [object holding key-value pairs](./src/policy.ts) that governs how _Simple Comment_ behaves, determining for instance maximum comment length or whether ordinary users can delete themselves
